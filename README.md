# Social Ape Social Media Application

## How to use

Create a profile and start screaming! Like and comment on your friends' screams!

## **Disclaimer**

This application was built by following a tutorial provided by Classsed on Youtube. Not my original work!

My goal in following alongside this application was to strengthen my understanding of the various tools being used. I'd like to give a very big thank you to Classsed for the tutorial! Links to his Youtube channel, tutorial, and Twitter can be found below!
